%SHOULD PROBABLY JUST DELETE ALL THIS. V UNORGANIZED.
Across migration rates we observe a large difference in:
gene flow, 
$F_{st}$ values,
amount of time until adaptation,
sharing of solutions (haplotytes?),
$SGV$,
and, migration load. 
we run multiple simulations across a range of migration rates starting at $5e-5$ and increasing by
one order of magnitude up to $.05$. 
With the marine and freshwater both at a population size 2000,
this represents exactly $1/10_{th}$, $1$, $10$, and $100$ migrants per generation, respectively. 

At low migration rates of $5e-5$ (1/10 migrants per generation), we observed little sharing of genetic solutions and 
almost no freshwater alleles existing in the marine population.
With an MPFAI of $0.0999$ in the original lakes;
each individual in the original lakes had almost exactly $1/10_{th}$ of the total FAA. 
In addition to each allele appearing in an average of $1.08$ lakes, 
this tells us that each of the 10 lakes has individually selected their own set of solutions (haplotypes) 
rather than sharing alleles through the marine. 
This is further supported by the low capacity of the marine to transport the alleles with an MPFAI of $0.003$.
$T_{adapt}$ remained on an ecological timescale of $18K$ generations, and the correlation of FAA frequencies was at $0.09$.
With the introduced population having an MPFAI of $0.02$, 
we see little evidence that the lakes were able the select on the alleles found in that marine. 
it may be important to note that while we are sampling the 10 introduced lakes as a whole population,
It is possible that only a couple of the lakes even received a copy some alleles during the introduction.
However, to see evidence of the haplotypes being carried throughout the marine we would expect to observe a pattern off all lakes
being able to select upon similar alleles. 
This observation gives a migration rate below the threshold needed to support the transportation hypothesis.

scaling up migration rates to $0.0005$ (1 migrants per generation)
we observe the first evidence of transportation.
The mean total number of FAA drops to 45 and the average number of lakes which each alleles appears in jumped to $1.33$. 
This shows us the gene flow between populations allowed for some freshwater alleles to travel through the marine and be shared by the lakes. 
Interestingly, with the marine showing an MPFAI of $0.02$, 
the introduced was much more able to select upon the alleles;
The introduced population showed a MPFAI of $0.078$, compared to the original lakes which was at $0.129$,
Looking at the FAA frequencies in the two freshwater populations at time of adaptation, we see a correlation of $.68$
While this is evidence of parallel local adaptation, the  $T_{adapt}$ was still at $8,365$ generations.

At $0.005$ (10 migrants per generation) we experience high correlation between the FAA frequencies
in the original and introduced populations, $0.96$, and rapid local adaptation of the introduced population, (81 generations). 
With the introduced population showing an MPFAI of  ~ $0.34$ which is strikingly close to the original freshwater population which is at $0.34$
This migration rate clearly shows the capacity to share alleles in order for us to see rapid and parallel adaptation.
 
Interestingly, is that if we look at the distribution and total amount of FAA in the marine population at time of introduction between 
$0.0005$ and $0.005$, they are virtually identical.
This comes with two questions
(1) why is there a similar amount of FAA in the marine with such a substantial difference in migration, and
(2) what is it about the higher migration rate of  $0.005$ that allows it perform so much better in terms of rapid adaptation? 
To answer the first question we can see that the median number of defined FAA is much higher, 45
While with the higher migration there is only a median of 10. 
This is a result of the solutions not being shared across the original lakes at lower migration rates.
This can be seen by the average number of lakes each FAA appears in being 
$1.54$ at 1 migrant per generation and 
$3.75$ at 10 migrants per generation.
consequently more alleles were defined as FAA and sampled as such in the marine population. 
This however does not explain why, at higher migration rates, 
the introduced freshwater population was able to rebuild the haplotype so much more quickly. 
For this, It is important to note that after introduction, there is continued migration. 
This means that for a migrate of $0.005$ there is roughly 10 times as 
much of the FAA being brought into the freshwater every generation compared to migrate $0.0005$.

This seams to suggest that continued migration is quite important 
for rapid adaptation at this migration rate as opposed to the simply the concentration of 
freshwater adapted alleles found in the marine. 

Note: we should probably investigate the distribution of effect size more to clearly answer the above questions ...

(NOTE:PETER/BILL how does this compare to what we see in nature

While both of the higher migration rates of $0.005$ and $0.05$ showed evidence of sharing alleles and rapid adaptation,
we see substantial difference in the median phenotype compared to the optimum for each subpopulation. 
This is because migration tends to oppose the natural divergence of populations undergoing ecological speciation. \cite{Bolnick}
Migration load depreciation of fitness between two subpopulations with a high amount of introgression between them. 
This is often observed in nature when the sharing of genes constricts the adaptation of both species. 

In our simulations, at high migration rates of $0.05$, 
we consistently saw this effect in all subpopulations.
