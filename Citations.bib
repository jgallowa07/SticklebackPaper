	abstract = {Species originate frequently by natural selection. A general mechanism by which this occurs is ecological speciation, defined as the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent natural selection. The alternative mechanism is mutation-order speciation in which populations fix different mutations as they adapt to similar selection pressures. Although numerous cases now indicate the importance of ecological speciation in nature, very little is known about the genetics of the process. Here, we summarize the genetics of premating and postzygotic isolation and the role of standing genetic variation in ecological speciation. We discuss the role of selection from standing genetic variation in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a complex of species whose ancestral marine form repeatedly colonized and adapted to freshwater environments. We propose that ecological speciation has occurred multiple times in parallel in this group via a {\textquotedblleft}transporter{\textquotedblright} process in which selection in freshwater environments repeatedly acts on standing genetic variation that is maintained in marine populations by export of freshwater-adapted alleles from elsewhere in the range. Selection from standing genetic variation is likely to play a large role in ecological speciation, which may partly account for its rapidity.},

abstract = {Migration tends to oppose the effects of divergent natural selection among populations. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that this migration?selection balance constrains genetic divergence among populations. In contrast, relatively few studies have examined immigration's effects on fitness and natural selection within recipient populations. By constraining local adaptation, migration can lead to reduced fitness, known as a ?migration load,? which in turn causes persistent natural selection. We develop a simple two?island model of migration?selection balance that, although very general, also reflects the natural history of Timema cristinae walking?stick insects that inhabit two host plant species that favor different cryptic color patterns. We derive theoretical predictions about how migration rates affect the level of maladaptation within populations (measured as the frequency of less?cryptic color?pattern morphs), which in turn determines the selection differential (the within?generation morph frequency change). Using data on color morph frequencies from 25 natural populations, we confirm previous results showing that maladaptation is higher in populations receiving more immigrants. We then present novel evidence that this increased maladaptation leads to larger selection differentials, consistent with our model. Our results provide comparative evidence that immigration elevates the variance in fitness, which in turn leads to larger selection differentials, consistent with Fisher's Theorem of Natural Selection. However, we also find evidence that recurrent adult migration between parapatric populations may tend to obscure the effects of selection.}

abstract={The evolutionary potential of populations is mainly determined by population size and available genetic variance. However, the adaptability of spatially structured populations may also be affected by dispersal: positively by spreading beneficial mutations across sub-populations, but negatively by moving locally adapted alleles between demes. We develop an individual-based, two-patch, allelic model to investigate the balance between these opposing effects on a population's evolutionary response to rapid climate change. Individual fitness is controlled by two polygenic traits coding for local adaptation either to the environment or to climate. Under conditions of selection that favour the evolution of a generalist phenotype (i.e. weak divergent selection between patches) dispersal has an overall positive effect on the persistence of the population. However, when selection favours locally adapted specialists, the beneficial effects of dispersal outweigh the associated increase in maladaptation for a narrow range of parameter space only (intermediate selection strength and low linkage among loci), where the spread of beneficial climate alleles is not strongly hampered by selection against non-specialists. Given that local selection across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes is common, the complex effect of dispersal that we describe will play an important role in determining the evolutionary dynamics of many species under rapidly changing climate.},

	abstract = {On several Alaskan islands, phenotypically variable threespine stickleback fish now live in ponds that were formed during uplift caused by the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake. We analyzed phenotypic and genome-wide genetic divergence of resident freshwater and oceanic threespine stickleback populations from three islands. These data support the hypothesis that the freshwater populations evolved repeatedly from their oceanic ancestors in the past half-century, and have differentiated to nearly the same extent as populations that were founded thousands of years ago. This work raises the possibility that much of the evolution that occurs when oceanic stickleback invade fresh water takes place in fewer than 50 generations after colonization, rather than gradually over thousands of years.How rapidly can animal populations in the wild evolve when faced with sudden environmental shifts? Uplift during the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake abruptly created freshwater ponds on multiple islands in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. In the short time since the earthquake, the phenotypes of resident freshwater threespine stickleback fish on at least three of these islands have changed dramatically from their oceanic ancestors. To test the hypothesis that these freshwater populations were derived from oceanic ancestors only 50 y ago, we generated over 130,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes from more than 1,000 individuals using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Population genomic analyses of these data support the hypothesis of recent and repeated, independent colonization of freshwater habitats by oceanic ancestors. We find evidence of recurrent gene flow between oceanic and freshwater ecotypes where they co-occur. Our data implicate natural selection in phenotypic diversification and support the hypothesis that the metapopulation organization of this species helps maintain a large pool of genetic variation that can be redeployed rapidly when oceanic stickleback colonize freshwater environments. We find that the freshwater populations, despite population genetic analyses clearly supporting their young age, have diverged phenotypically from oceanic ancestors to nearly the same extent as populations that were likely founded thousands of years ago. Our results support the intriguing hypothesis that most stickleback evolution in fresh water occurs within the first few decades after invasion of a novel environment.},

Despite increasing documentation of evolutionarily important SGV in natural populations, we still know little about how the genetic and genomic structure and molecular evolutionary history of SGV relate to adaptation. Here, we address this knowledge gap using the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. We demonstrate that adaptive genetic variation is structured genome-wide into distinct marine and freshwater haplogroups. This divergent variation averages six million years old, nearly twice the genome-wide average, but has been evolving over the 15-million-year history of the species. Divergent marine and freshwater genomes maintain regions of ancient ancestry that include multiple chromosomal inversions and extensive linked variation. These discoveries about ancient SGV demonstrate the intertwined nature of selection on ecological timescales and genome evolution over geological timescales.},

For instance, rock pocket mice are often found with a coat color that matches the rocks they live in, these color differences are controlled genetically, and mice that don?t match the local rock color are more likely to be eaten by predators. Sometimes, similar genetic changes have occurred independently in different patches, suggesting that there were few accessible ways to evolve the locally adaptive form. However, the genetic basis could also be shared if migrants carry the locally beneficial genotypes between nearby patches, despite being at a disadvantage between the patches. We use a mathematical model of random migration to determine how quickly adaptation is expected to occur through new mutation and through migration from other patches, and study in more detail what we would expect successful migrations between patches to look like. The results are useful for determining whether similar adaptations in different locations are likely to have the same genetic basis or not, and more generally in understanding how species adapt to patchy, heterogeneous landscapes.},

@article{haller2018treesequence,
  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for evolutionary models to incorporate relatively realistic dynamics, ranging from selection at many genomic sites to complex demography, population structure, and ecological interactions. Such models can generally be implemented as individual-based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher et al., 2018), which stores the genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from forward-time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using "recapitation"; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population{\textquoteright}s genealogy that can be analyzed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in SLiM 3 (a free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modeling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

In this paper, we describe a way to record all of these relationships, as well as how genetic material is passed down through the pedigree, during a forwards-time population genetic simulation. To make effective use of this information, we describe both efficient storage methods for this embellished pedigree as well as a way to remove all information that is irrelevant to the genetic history of a given set of individuals, which dramatically reduces the required amount of storage space. Storing this information allows us to produce whole-genome sequence from simulations of large populations in which we have not explicitly recorded new genomic mutations; we find that this results in computational run times of up to 50 times faster than simulations forced to explicitly carry along that information.},

  abstract = {With the desire to model population genetic processes under increasingly realistic scenarios, forward genetic simulations have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright–Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright–Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright–Fisher or “nonWF” model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use.},

  abstract = {We link two-allele population models by Haldane and Fisher with Kimura's diffusion approximations of the Wright-Fisher model, by considering continuous-state branching (CB) processes which are either independent (model I) or conditioned to have constant sum (model II). Recent works by the author allow us to further include logistic density-dependence (model III), which is ubiquitous in ecology. In all models, each allele (mutant or resident) is then characterized by a triple demographic trait: intrinsic growth rate r, reproduction variance sigma and competition sensitivity c. Generally, the fixation probability u of the mutant depends on its initial proportion p, the total initial population size z, and the six demographic traits. Under weak selection, we can linearize u in all models thanks to the same master formula u = p + p(1 - p)[g(r)s(r) + g(sigma)s(sigma) + g(c)s(c)] + o(s(r),s(sigma),s(c), where s(r) = r' - r, s(sigma) = sigma-sigma' and s(c) = c - c' are selection coefficients, and g(r), g(sigma), g(c) are invasibility coefficients (' refers to the mutant traits), which are positive and do not depend on p. In particular, increased reproduction variance is always deleterious. We prove that in all three models g(sigma) = 1/sigma and g(r) = z/sigma for small initial population sizes z. In model II, g(r) = z/sigma for all z, and we display invasion isoclines of the 'mean vs variance' type. A slight departure from the isocline is shown to be more beneficial to alleles with low sigma than with high r. In model III, g(c) increases with z like ln(z)/c, and g(r)(z) converges to a finite limit L > K/sigma, where K = r/c is the carrying capacity. For r > 0 the growth invasibility is above z/sigma when z  K, showing that classical models I and II underestimate the fixation probabilities in growing populations, and overestimate them in declining populations.},

@article{barton2001hybridization,
  abstract = {Hybridization may influence evolution in a variety of ways. If hybrids are less fit, the geo-
graphical range of ecologically divergent populations may be limited, and prezygotic
reproductive isolation may be reinforced. If some hybrid genotypes are fitter than one or
both parents, at least in some environments, then hybridization could make a positive con-
tribution. Single alleles that are at an advantage in the alternative environment and genetic
background will introgress readily, although such introgression may be hard to detect.
‘Hybrid speciation’, in which fit combinations of alleles are established, is more problematic;
its likelihood depends on how divergent populations meet, and on the structure of epistasis.
These issues are illustrated using Fisher’s model of stabilizing selection on multiple traits,
under which reproductive isolation evolves as a side-effect of adaptation in allopatry. This
confirms a priori arguments that while recombinant hybrids are less fit on average, some
gene combinations may be fitter than the parents, even in the parental environment.
Fisher’s model does predict heterosis in diploid F 1 s, asymmetric incompatibility in reciprocal
backcrosses, and (when dominance is included) Haldane’s Rule. However, heterosis arises
only when traits are additive, whereas the latter two patterns require dominance. Moreover,
because adaptation is via substitutions of small effect, Fisher’s model does not generate the
strong effects of single chromosome regions often observed in species crosses.},

  abstract = {Niche dimensionality is suggested to be a key determinant of ecological speciation (“multifarious selection” hypothesis), but genetic aspects of this process have not been investigated theoretically. We use Fisher's geometrical model to study how niche dimensionality influences the mean fitness of hybrids formed upon secondary contact between populations adapting in allopatry. Gaussian selection for an optimum generates two forms of reproductive isolation (RI): an extrinsic component due to maladaptation of the mean phenotype, and an intrinsic variance load resulting from what we term transgressive incompatibilities between mutations fixed in different populations. We show that after adaptation to a new environment, RI increases with (1) the mean initial maladaptation of diverging population, and (2) niche dimensionality, which increases the phenotypic variability of fixed mutations. Under mutation selection drift equilibrium in a constant environment, RI accumulates steadily with time, at a rate that also increases with niche dimensionality. A similar pattern can be produced by successive shifts in the optimum phenotype. Niche dimensionality thus has an effect per se on postzygotic isolation, beyond putative indirect effects (stronger selection, more genes). Our mechanism is consistent with empirical evidence about transgressive segregation in crosses between divergent populations, and with patterns of accumulation of RI with time in many taxa.},

  abstract = {Both evolution and ecology have long been concerned with the impact of
variable environmental conditions on observed levels of genetic diversity
within and between species. We model the evolution of a quantitative trait
under selection that fluctuates in space and time, and derive an analytical
condition for when these fluctuations promote genetic diversification. As
ecological scenario we use a generalized island model with soft selection
within patches in which we incorporate generation overlap. We allow for
arbitrary fluctuations in the environment including spatio-temporal
correlations and any functional form of selection on the trait. Using the
concepts of invasion fitness and evolutionary branching, we derive a simple and
transparent condition for the adaptive evolution and maintenance of genetic
diversity. This condition relates the strength of selection within patches to
expectations and variances in the environmental conditions across space and
time. Our results unify, clarify, and extend a number of previous results on
the evolution and maintenance of genetic variation under fluctuating selection.
Individual-based simulations show that our results are independent of the
details of the genetic architecture and on whether reproduction is clonal or
sexual. The onset of increased genetic variance is predicted accurately also in
small populations in which alleles can go extinct due to environmental
stochasticity.},

  abstract = {Many ecologically important traits have a complex genetic basis, with the potential for mutations at many different genes to shape the phenotype. Even so, studies of local adaptation in heterogeneous environments sometimes find that just a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effect can explain a large percentage of observed differences between phenotypically divergent populations. As high levels of gene flow can swamp divergence at weakly selected alleles, migration-selection-drift balance may play an important role in shaping the genetic architecture of local adaptation. Here, we use analytical approximations and individual-based simulations to explore how genetic architecture evolves when two populations connected by migration experience stabilizing selection toward different optima. In contrast to the exponential distribution of allele effect sizes expected under adaptation without migration (Orr 1998), we find that adaptation with migration tends to result in concentrated genetic architectures with fewer, larger, and more tightly linked divergent alleles. Even if many small alleles contribute to adaptation at the outset, they tend to be replaced by a few large alleles under prolonged bouts of stabilizing selection with migration. All else being equal, we also find that stronger selection can maintain linked clusters of locally adapted alleles over much greater map distances than weaker selection. The common empirical finding of QTL of large effect is shown to be expected with migration in a heterogeneous landscape, and these QTL may often be composed of several tightly linked alleles of smaller effect.},

@article{karlin1982classifications,
  abstract = {The idea that levels and forms of genetic variability can be related
to temporal and spatial patterns of environmental heterogeneity is a
widely promulgated theme in evolutionary biology. Recent reviews per-
taining to genetic polymorphisms under conditions of variable selection
and migration are given by Hedrick et at (1976) and Felsenstein (1976) ,
which include numerous references to experimental. field, and theoretical
studies.
ies.
Three classes of migration patterns have been predominantly studied
in theoretical population genetics:
a. The island model (Wright, 1943) consists of an array of islands
exchanging genes uniformly. Equivalently, the island model involves N
"equidistant" islands thai share a common migrant pool drawn equally
from all demes.
The Levene population subdivision structure (1953) is a direct gen·
eralization of Wright's model that allows for variable deme (island) sizes.
Deakin (1966) introduced a homing or sessile tendency so that some
individuals would remain in their deme of birth rather than enter the
migrant pool. He assumed that a fixed proportion of the population is
sessile while the remainder of the population acts according to the Levene
model.
b. The stepping-stone model and. more generaJly. isolation-by-dis-
lance migration patterns assume that the rates of migration between
demes depend on the distances between them. Isolation by distance based
on a o ne, two, or even higher dimensional layout (strata defined by phys-
ical position, social or behavioral characteristics) of the population has
been investigated by Maleeo! (1948, 195 1. 1959, 1967), Jain and Bradshaw
(1966), Kimura and Weiss (1964) , Maruyama (1970), among others. This
class of models generall y involves no differential selection within or be-
tween locaJities. In the context of environmental selection gradients. some
cline stepping-stone models have been extensively investigated (e.g., Slat-
kin , 1973; Nagylaki, 1974. 1975, 1976b, 1978, 1979; Nagylaki and Lucier,
1980; F leming, 1975; Karlin and Richter-Dyn, 1976).
c. Migration matrix models are designed to deal with general migra-
tion patterns (e.g., Malecot, 195 1, 1959; Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza. 1968;
Carmelli and Cavalli-Sforza. 1976; Smith , 1969). Most authors have lim-
ited their attention to linear pressures. i.e ., mutation andlor migration
from an external fixed population, but having no mating or natural se-
lection differences operating.
In both classes of migration structures (b) and (c), computations have
been mainly directed to evaluating the correlation of gene freque ncies
over space and the changes of these with time.
T his work is part of a continuing series of theoretical studies that
seek to understand the effects of different types of spatially and temporally
varying selection regimes coupled with migration patterns on the exist-
ence and nature of polymorphism (Karlin, 1976. 1977a, b ; Karlin and
Richter-Dyn, 1976; Karlin and Campbell . 1978. 1979, 1980). In this chapter
we establish the conditions for the existence of a protected polymorphism
(protection means that none of the alleles become extinct even when
initiall y rare) for a hierarchy of migration patterns. These results will
permit qualitative comparisons of the influence of different structures of
migration exc hange in contributing to the maintenance of polymorph isms.
In this review we describe a series of hybrid migration structures
composed from canonical, e.g .• Levene. Deakin . stepping-stone. circu-
lant migration patterns that entail one or several clusters of demes. Deme
clusters can reflect the background terrain. geographical relationships ,
geological. climatic. or other ecological and environmental factors. and
also behavioral, social, or exogenous genetic-environmental character-
istics . Moreover. by introducing suitable fict itious deme arrays we can simulate the effects of seasonal variation in selection by a spatial selection
gradient. T he seasons often induce cyclic variation.
Some of the models are partly motivated by observations from insect
populations that divide into demes or groups of demes , depending on the
spacing of the plants on which they feed. Natural groupings of demes can
also be associated with arrays of islands, an archipelago. tributaries of
a river, inlets along a coast. a range of hills, spacing of flora. or moun-
tain-valley-canyon topography.
The partitioning of demes into clusters often distinguishes local pop-
ulation interactions against far movements. For example, with respect to
plant dispersal we can contrast t he nearby seed droppings with the long
migrations mediated by vectors (insects, mammals).
A three-tiered clustering of some human populations may arise from
the family-tribe, nation, and race structures. Other criteria for groupings
may relate to social economic status, life-styles, religion and customs.
and educational levels .
Conditions for clustering may be based on aspects ofthe environment
such as degree and kind of salinity. food availability . moistness, exposure,
etc. T he modeling of migration should reflect various levels of clustering
and associated with the clustering is a related pattern of selection.
We will investigate typically the following questions: To what extent
is the maintenance of polymorphism facilitated by the nature of hierar-
chical determinations of deme clustering? What are the consequences
associated with asymmetries in population exchanges? What are the rel-
ative influences of migration rates between and within clusters of demes?
Also, how do we compare spatial versus temporal variations in selection
and migration parameters?
The text is arranged as follow s. The migration patterns on which we
focu s are described in Sections 2-4. In Section 2 we review the formu-
lation of the Levene and Deakin migration models and their extensions
that allow variable (habitat-dependent) rates of homing, several stages of
migration in each life cycle, and different characteristic deme sizes. The
nature of c1inal flow , i.e., migration exchanges per generation limited to
neighboring demes whose rates can vary with respect to positions andlor
differ in reciprocal directions. is described. A number of relevant circulant
migration patterns are set forth. A final class of basic migration forms
involving d irectional migration via a distinguished (major) deme dispers-
ing to or receiving from "subordinate" demes is detailed. The process
of delayed germination in plant species with seed pools can be modeled
by such a migration scheme.
Sections 3 and 4 delineate more-complex migration structures encompassing clusters of several demes each. A population is assumed to
naturally divide into clusters with each cluster consisting of a number of
demes where the migration contrasts refer to intra- and interdeme cluster
movements. For example. a "slar" migration form is developed where
demes along each ray communicate only through a central deme. The
combined effects accruing from temporal and spatial variation can be
studied expeditiously by regarding the aggregate population as consisting
of a multicluster deme formation. Other relevant hybrid migration struc-
tures, such as Kronecker products and generalized circulant migration
systems, are also elaborated. For all these cases we ascertain the con-
ditions for a protected polymorphism and discern their dependence on
the model parameters.
The analytic apparatus used in ascertaining protection for the general
multideme migration-selection model is reviewed at the close of Section
1. Sections 7-10 present conditions for a protected polymorphism ap-
propriate for the models of Sections 2-4.
It is of interest to contrast migration structures as to their degrees
of mixing and isolation. Two such notions were introduced in Karlin
(1976). Several additional concepts and their analyses are set forth in
Section 5. A number of means of comparing selection heterogeneity are
introduced and some robust results interpreted in Section 6. Specifically,
we address the issue of the relationship between spatial or temporal se.
lection " heterogeneity " and the existence of a protected polymorphism.
In Section II we compare the opportunities for protection with mi.
gration once per season versus once per generation for a multideme pop.
ulation subject to seasonal selection variation. The conditions for pro·
tection in a multideme seed pool process are delineated in Section 13. A
number of relations of deme size distributions and allele protection are
de veloped in Section 14. Some models of mUltiple migration stages per
generation are investigated in Section 15. We set forth in Section 16 a
number of result s pertaining to the existence of protection attendant to
the addition or deletion of demes. In this vein. we examine the effects
with respect to protection of the unification or the separation of different
parts ofa population range. It is also of interest to ascertain the similarities
and contrasts in the equilibrium gene frequency patterns that accrue from
an enlarged neutral zone where in other respects the selection migration
structure is unchanged.
The discussion of Section 17 summarizes in qualitative terms some
of the implications and contrasts of the quantitative results of the previous
sections. Mathematical proofs and analyses are relegated to Appendices
A-F. The reader not concerned with the technical developments hence-
forth may best concentrate on Sections 1-4 to understand the spirit of the formulations and motivations on the various migration structures, and
then skip to Section 17 for the qualitative summary and discussion of the
results.},

  abstract = {In general, individuals who survive to reproduce have genotypes that work relatively well under local conditions. Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

abstract={Abstract Although FST is widely used as a measure of population structure, it has been criticized recently because of its dependency on within-population diversity. This dependency can lead to difficulties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, F?ST and D. F?ST is the normal FST standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (FST, F?ST and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4?years of Molecular Ecology. As with FST, unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and F?ST. Here, we develop a new unbiased F?ST estimator based on GST, which we call G??ST. However, F?ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either F?ST or D. In most cases, F?ST would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the influence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

A key strength of such coalescent models is that they enable efficient simulation of data we might see under a variety of evolutionary scenarios. However, current methods are not well suited to simulating genome-scale data sets on hundreds of thousands of samples, which is essential if we are to understand the data generated by population-scale sequencing projects. Similarly, processing the results of large simulations also presents researchers with a major challenge, as it can take many days just to read the data files. In this paper we solve these problems by introducing a new way to represent information about the ancestral process. This new representation leads to huge gains in simulation speed and storage efficiency so that large simulations complete in minutes and the output files can be processed in seconds.},

abstract={Abstract We investigated the interplay between natural selection and gene flow in the adaptive divergence of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that reside parapatrically in lakes and streams. Within the Misty Lake system (Vancouver Island, British Columbia), stickleback from the inlet stream (flowing into the lake) have fewer gill rakers and deeper bodies than stickleback from the lake?differences thought to facilitate foraging (benthic macroinvertebrates in the stream vs. zooplankton in the open water of the lake). Common-garden experiments demonstrated that these differences have a genetic basis. Reciprocal transplant enclosure experiments showed that lake and inlet stickleback grow best in their home environments (although differences were subtle and often not significant). Release-recapture experiments in the inlet showed that lake fish are less well-suited than inlet fish for life in the stream (higher mortality or emigration in lake fish). Morphological divergence in the wild and under common rearing was greater between the lake and the inlet than between the lake and the outlet. Genetic divergence (mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites) was greatest between the lake and the upper inlet (1.8 km upstream from the lake), intermediate between the lake and the lower inlet (0.9 km upstream), and least between the lake and the outlet stream (1.2 km downstream). Relative levels of gene flow estimated from genetic data showed the inverse pattern. The negative association between morphological divergence and gene flow is consistent with the expectation that gene flow can constrain adaptation. Estimated absolute levels of gene flow also implied a constraint on adaptation in the outlet but not the inlet. Our results suggest that natural selection promotes the adaptive divergence of lake and stream stickleback, but that the magnitude of divergence can be constrained by gene flow.},

This is in part due to the limited evidence in humans for classic "hard selective sweeps", wherein a novel beneficial mutation rapidly sweeps through a population to fixation. However, positive selection may often proceed via "soft sweeps" acting on mutations already present within a population. Here, we examine recent positive selection across six human populations using a powerful machine learning approach that is sensitive to both hard and soft sweeps. We found evidence that soft sweeps are widespread and account for the vast majority of recent human adaptation. Surprisingly, our results also suggest that linked positive selection affects patterns of variation across much of the genome, and may increase the frequencies of deleterious mutations. Our results also reveal insights into the role of sexual selection, cancer risk, and central nervous system development in recent human evolution.},
